This directory contains the raw .xlsx files from Pam 

- [20180125-Crab-Collection-DATA_DNA-plates.xlsx](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-crab/blob/master/data/20180125-Crab-Collection-DATA_DNA-plates.xlsx)     
This file contains crab morphology data as well as _Hematodinium_ assay and blood smears results of all original crabs delivered. No FRP numbers included. Will need to figure out how to assign the correct FRPs to the crabs so that this can be included into a large master file. 

- [20180125-NPRB-crab-sample-data.xlsx](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-crab/blob/master/data/20180125-NPRB-crab-sample-data.xlsx)   
This file contains data taken during the sampling of hemolymph. It includes crab IDs, maturity status, infection status, and tube numbers that the hemolymph samples are stored in.

- [20180518-Hemato_qPCR_results.xlsx](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-crab/blob/master/data/20180518-Hemato_qPCR_results.xlsx)     
This is a master workbook from Pam that contains all of the data from her qPCR runs on samples form Day 0/1 and Day 26. There are multiple tabs. To make the [20180522-master-qPCR-all-runs.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RobertsLab/project-crab/master/data/20180522-master-qPCR-all-runs.csv) I took all the data from the "all runs" tab which is ALL the data. 

- [20180702-crab-sampling-file.xls](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-crab/blob/master/data/20180702-crab-sampling-file.xls)
This file is the same as the .csv, except that it contains tabs for each proposed pooling scheme for three libraries. It also contains a pool created so Sam can test out an RNeasy Cleanup Kit.
