This folder contains data from crab collection/maturity data, PCR *Hematodinium spp.* data, and hemolymph collection data.

This file contains data taken during the sampling of hemolymph. It includes crab IDs, maturity status, infection status, and tube numbers that the hemolymph samples are stored in.

This file contains crab morphology data as well as _Hematodinium_ assay and blood smears results of all original crabs delivered.

Following crabs throughout the experiment
These data are from the master spreadsheet from Pam and the tab labeled "3 samples per crab". I removed some excess comulmns: Tag number (high and low); sample?; where. 

We have 113 crabs that have a sample for each of the three time points.

Crabs included have either 0 (uninfected) or 1 (infected) infection status.
	No 3 (uncertain) crabs are included. There are only 3 crabs with an infection status of "3" and all are Mature. 

Tabs separate the crabs according to the temperature treatment (cold, ambient, warm) and infection status (I = infected; U = uninfected). 
Within each tab, all of the immature crabs are listed first, then a gray row, then the mature crabs are listed. 

Black boxes around sets of three rows (green, pink, yellow) represent samples coming from one individual crab

The holding tank is where the crabs were before Day 9 sampling day. They were only kept in tanks 1-3 and 7-9. They are listed as 1C, 2C, 3C, and 7A, 8A, and 9A because that is what those tanks were going to become after the Day 9 sampling day and temperatures were to be changed. 

ALL CRABS START AT AMBIENT AND THEN ARE MOVED TO EITHER COLD, WARM, OR REMAIN IN AMBIENT TANKS

There are NO MATURE crabs in:
Cold, infected
Ambient, infected
Warm, infected
Warm, uninfected
