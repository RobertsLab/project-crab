This folder contains data from crab collection/maturity data, PCR *Hematodinium spp.* data, and hemolymph collection data. 

- [20180125-NPRB-crab-sample-data.xlsx](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-crab/blob/master/data/20180125-NPRB-crab-sample-data.xlsx)
This file contains data taken during the sampling of hemolymph. It includes crab IDs, maturity status, infection status, and tube numbers that the hemolymph samples are stored in.

- [20180125-Crab-Collection-DATA_DNA-plates.xlsx](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-crab/blob/master/data/20180125-Crab-Collection-DATA_DNA-plates.xlsx) 
This file contains crab morphology data as well as _Hematodinium_ assay and blood smears results of all original crabs delivered.

- [Qubit-consolidated.csv](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-crab/blob/master/data/Qubit-consolidated.csv)
This file contains RNA quantification data from Qubit High Sensitivity taken throughout the RNA isolation attempts. 

- [samples-for-RNA-isolation.csv](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-crab/blob/master/data/samples-for-RNA-isolation.csv)
This file contains a subset of samples selected for RNA isolation (from crabs that survived experiment)

- [20180309-crab-hemo-sample-data.csv](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-crab/blob/master/data/20180309-crab-hemo-sample-data.csv)
These data are from the master spreadsheet from Pam and the tab labeled "3 samples per crab". I removed some excess comulmns.

**The crabs can be identified using the FRP number in the first column. Each crab has three rows of data (becuase of the three sampling dates).**

We have 113 crabs that have a sample for each of the three time points.

Crabs included have either 0 (uninfected) or 1 (infected) infection status.
	There are only 3 crabs with an infection status of "3" and all are Mature. "3" denotes an unsure infection status.

Both Mature (M) and Immature (I) are included. 

The holding tank is where the crabs were before Day 9 sampling day. They were only kept in tanks 1-3 and 7-9. They are listed as 1C, 2C, 3C, and 7A, 8A, and 9A because that is what those tanks became after the Day 9 sampling day and temperatures were to be changed. 

ALL CRABS START AT AMBIENT AND THEN ARE MOVED TO EITHER COLD, WARM, OR REMAIN IN AMBIENT TANKS

There are NO MATURE crabs in:
Cold, infected
Ambient, infected
Warm, infected
Warm, uninfected
