This folder contains data from crab collection/maturity data, PCR *Hematodinium spp.* data, hemolymph collection data, RNA isolation and RNA HS Qubit results, and qPCR and DNA Qubit results.

This file contains crab morphology data as well as _Hematodinium_ assay and blood smears results of all original crabs delivered. No FRP numbers included. Will need to figure out how to assign the correct FRPs to the crabs so that this can be included into a large master file. 

- [20180125-NPRB-crab-sample-data.xlsx](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-crab/blob/master/data/20180125-NPRB-crab-sample-data.xlsx)   
This file contains data taken during the sampling of hemolymph. It includes crab IDs, maturity status, infection status, and tube numbers that the hemolymph samples are stored in.

These data are the RNA isolation results and RNA HS Qubit results from ALL samples that I have attempted RNA isolation on.

This is a master workbook from Pam that contains all of the data from her qPCR runs on samples form Day 0/1 and Day 26. There are multiple tabs. To make the [20180522-master-qPCR-all-runs.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RobertsLab/project-crab/master/data/20180522-master-qPCR-all-runs.csv) I took all the data from the "all runs" tab which is ALL the data.

This file is DIRECTLY COPY AND PASTED from Pam's [20180125-NPRB-crab-sample-data.xlsx](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-crab/blob/master/data/20180125-NPRB-crab-sample-data.xlsx) tab "all crabs". Has every single crab used in experiment listed with FRP number, infections status. Includes the crabs that died along the way.

These data are taken from the "all runs" tab in the [20180518-master_Hemato_qPCR_results.xlsx](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-crab/blob/master/data/20180518-master_Hemato_qPCR_results.xlsx) excel workbook from Pam. This file contains ALL data from all of Pam's qPCR runs.

These data are an _almost_ master of the RNA Qubit isolation data, the qPCR data, and the hemolymph sampling data. Not a true master file, but will be used to pick samples for RNA sequencing. The samples selected for sequencing are labeled with an "X" in the "PICK" column.

**Individual crabs can be identified via the FRP number. In some sheets, there is a "year-FRP" and a "FRP" column. The "year-FRP" is formatted '2017-####', and in all sheets there is a "FRP" column, which excludes the year becauase are from 2017.**

We have 113 crabs that have a sample for each of the three time points (survived the entire experiment).

Crabs included have either 0 (uninfected) or 1 (infected) infection status, as determined by a conventional PCR (cPCR) assay on Day 0/1 (when they were brought to the lab). Some crabs may have an infection status of "3", which indicates that the cPCR results were inconclusive. 

The holding tank is where the crabs were before Day 9 sampling day. They were only kept in tanks 1-3 and 7-9. They are listed as 1C, 2C, 3C, and 7A, 8A, and 9A because that is what those tanks became after the Day 9 sampling day and temperatures were to be changed. 

ALL CRABS START AT AMBIENT AND THEN ARE MOVED TO EITHER COLD, WARM, OR REMAIN IN AMBIENT TANKS
