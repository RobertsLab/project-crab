This folder contains files of Temperature data from the Juneau lab.

The temperature was recorded using Hobo TidBits.   

The names of the loggers are as follows:
Cold tanks: Bashful, Doc, Dopey   
Warm tanks: Grumpy, Happy, Sleepy   
Ambient tanks: Sneezy, EvilQueen, Snow White   

The order is from the left side of the room (if facing the tanks with your back to the garage door) to the right (nearest the lab room).
