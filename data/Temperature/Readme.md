This folder contains files of Temperature data from the Juneau lab.

The temperature was recorded using Hobo TidBits.   

The names of the loggers are as follows:
Cold tanks: Bashful, Doc, Dopey   
Warm tanks: Grumpy, Happy, Sleepy   
Ambient tanks: Sneezy, EvilQueen, Snow White   
  
The files are named:   
Name_temp_tank#   

Name is the name of the TidBit (character from Snow White)   
Temp is the temp designation for the tank (cold, warm, ambient)   
Tank# is the number of the tank (1 through 9)   

The order is from the left side of the room (if facing the tanks with your back to the garage door) to the right (nearest the lab room).
