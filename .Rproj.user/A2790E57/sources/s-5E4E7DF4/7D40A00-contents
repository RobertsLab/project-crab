install package: readxl
```{r}
install.packages("readxl")
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(readxl)
```

Read in files to join
```{r}
qubit <- read_excel("../data/master-qubit.xlsx", sheet = "qubit-iso")
sample <- read.csv("../analyses/sample_table.csv")
```

Join files based on "tube_number" column
```{r}
master <- left_join(sample, qubit, by = "tube_number")
head(master)
```
