Script for formatting files for GO-MWU. 

GO-MWU needs two files comprised of all inputs (not just the DEGs):
1. tab-delimited file: two columns - gene IDs and GO terms separated by semicolons
2. .csv file: two columns - gene IDs and continuous measure of significance, like p-values. 

Again, both files need to be all data inputs, not just the DEGs.
