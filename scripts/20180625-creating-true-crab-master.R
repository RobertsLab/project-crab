#Script for making a TRUE crab master file. Still missing FRP numbers for the 20180125-Crab-Collection-DATA_DNA-plates.xlsx. This file has morph and _Hematodinium_ blood smear data from the day all the crabs were delivered to the lab (Day 0 and 1)

library(dplyr)

#Need to get all the data in 20180522-master-all-crabs-hemo.csv, 20180522-master-qPCR-all-runs.csv, and 20180514-master-Qubit-RNA-isolation.csv such that each row is an individual crab.
