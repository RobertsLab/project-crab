R markdown for cleaning up Pam's qPCR results spreadsheet and joining with Crab RNA extraction spreadsheet. 

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
```

#### Read in qpcr csv (taken from "all good by sample" tab in project-crab/data/Excel-data-from-Pam/20180518_Hemato_qPCR_results) 
Note: I replaced "N/A"s in the "sq" column with "0"s
```{r}
qpcr <- read.csv("../analyses/hemat_qPCR.csv")
```

Take mean of starting quantities and group by FRP number. Add to column "sq_all.runs_mean"
```{r}
qpcr <- qpcr %>%
  group_by(FRP) %>%
  mutate(sq_all.runs_mean = mean(sq))
```

Reduce number of rows to one row per FRP number
```{r}

```
Reduce number of columns to "target", "sq", "sq_all.runs_mean", "sample_pos.neg", "FRP"
```{r}

```
