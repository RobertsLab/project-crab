R markdown for cleaning up Pam's qPCR results spreadsheet and joining with Crab RNA extraction spreadsheet. 

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
```

#### Read in qpcr csv (taken from "all good by sample" tab in project-crab/data/Excel-data-from-Pam/20180518_Hemato_qPCR_results) 
Note: I replaced "N/A"s in the "sq" column with "0"s
```{r}
qpcr <- read.csv("../analyses/hemat_qPCR.csv")
```

```{r}
qpcr$sq_all.runs_mean <- tapply(qpcr$sq, qpcr$FRP, mean)
```
