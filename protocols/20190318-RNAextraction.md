Bairdi RNA extraction: RNeasy Plus Micro Kit with QIA Shredder Columns

If opening a new kit, be sure to follow the manual for preparing buffers

**24 samples, two from each of the treatment/infection-status groups**

### Supplies needed:
Gloves       
Pipet tips for P1000, P200, and P100       
Pipets: P1000, P200, and P100        
Vacuum for columns     
Centrifuge       
RNase-free Falcon tubes (for making ethanols and BufferRLT plus B-ME)        
RNase-free snap cap tubes         

Qiagen RNeasy Plus Micro Kit        
Qiagen QIA shredder columns        
100% ethanol           
0.1% DEPC-treated water

### Make solutions fresh before each set of 24
### Solutions to make:   
70% ethanol (6.125mL ethanol + 2.625mL DEPC-treated H2O)        
80% ethanol (10mL ethanol + 2.5mL DEPC-treated H2O)         
Buffer RLT plus B-ME (9mL Buffer RLT + 90ul B-ME)     


### Sample preparation:
Let the 24 samples thaw on wet ice       
Vortex samples a few seconds       
Sample out 15ul of slurry into new LABELED RNase-free snap cap tubes   
 

### RNA extraction protocol:    
1. Add 350ul of Buffer RLT Plus + B-ME solution. Vortex to mix.   
2. Transfer lysate to QIA Shredder column with 2ml collection tube. Centrifuge 2min at 
full speed        
3. Transfer flow-through to gDNA Elimninator column with 2ml collection tube. Centrifuge for 30s at full speed. Discard column. **Save flow-through**
4. Add 350ul 70% ethanol to flow-through. Mix by pipetting.  
6. Transfer sample (including any precipitate that may have formed) to RNeasy MinElute column in a 2ml collection tube (from fridge in 209). Vacuum.   
7. Add 750ul Buffer RW1 to RNeasy column (use repeat pipet). Close lid. Vacuum.   
8. 500ul Buffer RPE to RNeasy column. Close lid. Vacuum.  
9. Add 500ul 80% ethanol to RNeasy column (use repeat pipet). Close lid. Vacuum 5 mins. 
10. Put RNeasy column in new 1.5 ml collection tube (provided in kit). Add 14ul RNase-free water to center of membrane. Close lid. Centrifuge for 1min at full speed. 

RNA is now eluted in 1.5ml collection tube. Put on wet ice, and continue to Qubit 

### Qubit: 
Run 1ul of each sample tube on Qubit using RNA High Sensitivity          
KEEP TRACK OF TUBE NUMBERS!!!!

#### Make working solution fresh each time:
3.2ml RNA Buffer         
26ul RNA dye

#### Label 2 tubes for standards: #1 and #2
10ul standard 1 and 190ul Buffer+dye solution       
10ul standard 2 and 190ul Buffer+dye solution        

#### Have the 12 tubes labeled:
1ul of sample, 199ul Buffer+dye solution

#### Running samples
Vortex all tubes        
Run standards        
Run samples (be sure to set to 1ul on Qubit)     

Data stored with the first sample tube at the bottom of the list (KEEP THIS IN MIND WHEN KEEPING TRACK OF TUBE LABELS)       


After each set of 24, immediately upload Qubit data, and manually add tube numbers
