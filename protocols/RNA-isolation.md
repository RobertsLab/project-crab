### RNA Isolation and Qubit for Tanner crab Hemolymph samples
## RNA Isolation (2.5-3 hrs for 9 samples)

Gathering materials/prepping reagents

(1) Prepare 75% ethanol with 0.1% DEPC-treated H2O. Use 200 proof ehtanol (100%). 
(2) Grab reagents:
- RNAzol RT (in 209 fridge)
- 2-propabol (under hood in 209)
- 75% ethanol (made above)
- 0.1% DEPC-treated H2O
- Ice

PPE --> Gloves, safety goggles, lab coat, fume hood

Equipment:
- Pipette (P1000)
- Pipette tips (P1000)
- Sterile snap cap tubes
- Microfuge
- Vortex

Procedure:
1. Add 1mL of RNAzol to tube containing hemolymph pellet (I pelleted them previously using the centrifuge).
2. Pipet to mix
3. Vortex 3s
4. Add 400µL of 0.1% DEPC-treated H2O
5. Vortex 15s
6. Incubate at room temperature for 15 mins
7. Centrifuge at 12,000g for 15 mins
8. Transfer 750mL of clear supernatant (avoid the blue RNAzol) to a clean snap cap tube. Discarded remaining liquid into RNAzol RT hazardous waste container in fume hood, left old tube open overnight in fume hood to dry out and discard in regular trash.
9. Add 750mL of 2-propanol. Mix by inversion.
10. Incubate at room temperature for 10 mins.
11. Centrifuge at 12,000 g for 15 mins
12. Discarded supernatant and careful to keep the white genetic material... sometimes floating above the bottom of the tube.
13. Centrifuge at 12,000 g for 15 mins.
14. Discard supernanatant.
15. Add 400µL of 75% ethanol 
16. Centrifuge at 8,000g for 3 mins.
17. Discard supernatant.
18. Repeat steps 15, 16, and 17 1x.
19. Centrifuge at 8,000g for 3 mins. Discard supernatant.
20. Resuspend pellet in 50µL of 0.1% DEPC-treated H2O.
Keep sample on ice for short term storage (no more than 2 hrs) or store at -80C.

## Qubit (~5 mins for 2 samples)
After RNA isolation, pick two samples out of the 9 to run on the Qubit.

Materials:
- Clean 1.7mL snap cap tube
- 4 Qubit snap cap tubes (small)
- P10 and P10 tips
- P200 and P200 tips
- P1000 and P1000 tips

Reagents: (all should be at room temperature)
- Qubit RNA High Sensitivity reagent (wrapped in foil)
- Qubit RNA Buffer
- 2 standards form 209 fridge: Standard #1(red cap) and Standard #2(yellow cap)

Make working solution
1. Add 4µL of Qubit reagent to 1.7mL snap cap tube
2. Add 796µL of Qubit RNA buffer to that same 1.7mL snap cap tube
3. Vortex 3s

Make standards solutions:
1. Add 10µL of standard #1 to a clean Qubit tube
2. Add 10µL of standard #2 to a second clean Qubit tube
3. Add 190µL of working solution to each of the standard Qubit tubes, so that each tube contains 200µL of liquid (10µL of standard, and 190µL of working solution)
4. Vortex both for 3s

Make samples:
1. Add 5µL of sample #1 into a clean Qubit tube
2. Add 195µL of working solution to sample #1 Qubit tube
3. Add 5µL of sample #2 into a clean Qubit tube
4. Add 198µL of working solution to sample #2 Qubit tube
5. Vortex both for 3s

Using the Qubit machine:
1. Tap screen to wake it up
2. Select RNA High Sensitivity
3. Select "Run Standards"
4. Insert standard #1, run standard.
5. Insert standard #2, run standard.
6. Insert sample #1, select "run sample".
7. Select the amount of sample (5µL).
8. Run sample.
9. Insert sample #2, select "run sample"
10. Select the amount of sample (5µL).
11. Run sample.
12. Export results to thumb drive.
