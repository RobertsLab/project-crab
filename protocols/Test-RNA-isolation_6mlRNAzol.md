## Testing new RNA Isolation for Tanner Crab Hemolymph Samples 

Gathering materials/prepping reagents

(1) Prepare 75% ethanol with 0.1% DEPC-treated H2O. Use 200 proof ehtanol (100%). 
(2) Grab reagents:
- RNAzol RT (in 209 fridge)
- 2-propanol (under hood in 209)
- 75% ethanol (made above)
- 0.1% DEPC-treated H2O (glass bottle RNA station FTR 209)
- Ice

PPE --> Gloves, safety goggles, lab coat, fume hood

Equipment:
- Pipette (P1000)
- Pipette tips (P1000)
- Sterile 13ml tubes (RNA station in FTR 209) (**Two per sample**)
- Centrifuge (FTR 213)
- Vortex

Procedure:
Transfer pelleted hemolymph to a LABELED clear, round-bottomed 13ml tube (found in RNA station in FTR 209)

1. Add 6mL of RNAzol to 13ml tube.
2. Pipet to mix
3. Vortex 3s (parafilm over the top of tube)
4. Add 2,400µL (2.4 ml) of 0.1% DEPC-treated H2O
5. Vortex 15s (parafilm over the top of tube)
6. Incubate at room temperature for 15 mins
7. Centrifuge at 12,000g for 15 mins
8. Transfer 4,500µL (4.5 ml) of light blue supernatant (avoiding all the pelleted dark blue at the bottom of the tube) to a **NEW LABEELED clean 13ml tube**. Discard remaining liquid into RNAzol RT hazardous waste container in fume hood, leave old tube open overnight in fume hood to dry out and discard in regular trash.
9. Add 4,500µL (4.5 ml) of 2-propanol (same as isopropanol). Parafilm over top of tube, and Mix by inversion.
10. Incubate at room temperature for 10 mins.
11. Centrifuge at 12,000 g for 15 mins
12. Discard supernatant and careful to keep the white genetic material... sometimes floating above the bottom of the tube. 
13. Centrifuge at 12,000 g for 15 mins.
14. Discard supernanatant.
15. Add 400µL of 75% ethanol 
16. Centrifuge at 8,000g for 3 mins.
17. Discard supernatant.
18. Repeat steps 15, 16, and 17 1x.
19. Centrifuge at 8,000g for 3 mins. Discard supernatant.
20. Resuspend (dissolve) pellet in 50µL of 0.1% DEPC-treated H2O.
Keep sample on ice for short term storage (no more than 2 hrs) or store at -80C.
